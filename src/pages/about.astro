        As non-traditional skaters, we usually couldn’t see ourselves reflected
        in skaters you would normally see at skateparks throughout Orange
        County- specifically in Santa Ana. The original founder, Dorian Romero
        took it upon herself to create a safe space for non-traditional skaters
        by hosting monthly skate meet ups at local skate parks for those who
        also have a love for skateboarding. The first meet up was held in March
        of 2019 at a large parking lot behind a probation office. Angela Banda
        attended the first meet up by discovering a flyer in the restroom of her
        favorite local bar- Mission Bar. During the first meet up, Angela
        connected with Dorian through their love of skateboarding and has since
        become an involved member of the group. Ashley Singleton heard about Sk8
        N Meet Santana by word of mouth while DJ’ing at El Indio Downtown Santa
        Ana. Ashley had finally found a relatable group of folks to skate with
        and attended her very first meet up in June of 2020 for the Black Lives
        Matter Go Skate Day Protest in Downtown LA. In late 2020, Dorian
        eventually handed off the organization to Angela and Ashley, and had
        them take over as leaders of the group due to their dedication and
        involvement. Since then, Sk8 N Meet Santana has grown by diversifying
        their meet up locations to various skate parks in the LA and OC area.
        The group has become a familiar face within the non-traditional skate
        scene by way of collaborating with other non-traditional skate groups
        throughout the SoCal area. Other involvement in the community includes
        features in LA skate magazines (TRASH Mag and Bigfoot Magazine),
        developing the very first Build-Your-Own-Skateboard Workshop for the
        youth of Santa Ana, and attending Skate Like A Girl’s, W.O.F. (Wheels of
        Fortune) in Seattle, WA.

            Angela
          </h2>
          <p>
            Angela is a recent graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in chemical
            engineering. She is currently studying to get her Master’s in Food
            Science. Angela enjoys dog sitting and spending quality time with
            her friends. In her alone time she likes to get cozy and watch
            movies or devote time to one of her hobbies. She became involved
            with Sk8 N Meet Santana by attending the 1st meet up back in March
            of 2019 when she was eager to find more friends to skate with in
            Santa Ana. Fate led her to serendipitously find the flier for the
            inaugural Sk8 N Meet Santana skate sesh in the restroom of a local
            Santa Ana bar called Mission Bar. After attending several meet ups,
            the organizer of the events, Dorian Romero, entrusted her to help
            cohost the and eventually take on the role of social media outreach
            and photo/video editing. Angela has shown great dedication to
            maintaining a welcoming environment for the local and surrounding
            communities of nontraditional skaters while representing female
            skaters of Orange County. She takes great pride in being involved
            and seeing the crew achieve new milestones in the skateboarding
            community.

            Ashley
          </h2>
          <p>
            Ashley is an eclectic artist within multiple realms of the creative
            scope. After graduating from FIDM (Fashion Institute of Design and
            Merchandising) with a degree in Fashion Design, Ashley realized that
            her passion for expressing her creativity gravitated more to graphic
            design. She became involved with Sk8 N Meet Santana in June 2020,
            after actively attending meet-ups and events hosted by the
            organization. Her leadership role at Sk8 N Meet Santana consists of
            designing flyers to the logo, branding and marketing, and taking
            amature professional photos when needed. Other than designing and
            skateboarding, Ashley is passionate about helping others in her
            community and DJ’ing from her personal vinyl set at local bars when
            her busy schedule allows it.
